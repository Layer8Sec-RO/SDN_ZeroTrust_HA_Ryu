SDN_ZeroTrust_HA_Ryu
This project presents a practical implementation of a modern enterprise network architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN), using the Ryu controller, and aligned with the Zero Trust security model. It includes high availability features, network segmentation, and advanced security policies.

Description
This solution is part of a Master's Final Project and aims to demonstrate how SDN technologies, combined with Zero Trust principles, can significantly enhance security in modern network architectures. It uses Ryu as the SDN controller and integrates tools like Snort for intrusion detection.

Features
Ryu controller with OpenFlow 1.3 support
Logical network segmentation
Identity-based access policies
IDS integration (Snort)
Network simulation using GNS3

Requirements
Python 3.6+
Ryu 4.34
GNS3
Snort (optional, for IDS integration)
Open vSwitch
